## üìñ  Description

This is a React application that allows the user to track kegs using full CRUD.  

This is an independent project for Epicodus week 16 as part of the "React Fundamentals" coursework. 

--------------------

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used

This project uses the following technologies:

- React
- JSX
- JavaScript ES6
- Bootstrap 5
- git/GitHub
- VS Code

## User Stories

| obj# | User Stories | Complete |
| :------------- | :------------- | :------------- |
| 01 | I want to see a list/menu of all available kegs. | ‚ùå |
| 02 | I want to submit a form to add a new keg to a list. | ‚ùå |
| 03 | I want to be able to click on a keg to see its detail page. | ‚ùå |
| 04 | I want to see how many pints are left in a keg. | ‚ùå |
| 05 | I want to be able to click a button next to a keg whenever I sell a pint of it. This should decrease the number of pints left by 1. Pints should not be able to go below 0. | ‚ùå |
| 06 | I want the option to edit a keg's properties after entering them just in case I make a mistake. | ‚ùå |
| 07 | I want to be able to delete a keg. | ‚ùå |
| 08 | I want a keg to update to say "Out of Stock" once it's empty. | ‚ùå |
| 09 | I want kegs with less than 10 pints to include a message that says "Almost Empty" so I can try a pint before it's gone! | ‚ùå |
| 10 | I want to have kegs prices to be color-coded for easy readability. This could be based on their price, the style of beer or kombucha, or the amount of pints left. | ‚ùå |

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can‚Äôt go back!**

If you aren‚Äôt satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you‚Äôre on your own.

You don‚Äôt have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn‚Äôt feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn‚Äôt be useful if you couldn‚Äôt customize it when you are ready for it.
